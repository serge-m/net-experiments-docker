# SSH server in docker

## Preparations

In order to make client connect to the server without asking for trusting the fingerprint one can use 
self-signed certificates. The procedure consists of 
* generating certificate keys
* generating server keys
* signing the server keys with the certificate
* configuring the sshd on server side
* adding the public certificate to the client's known_hosts
* generating key pair for the client
* adding the public key of the client to the server's authorized keys

Run

    ./generate_keys.sh

## Running

* build and run 


      docker-compose up --build
    
* now you can ssh to a client and connect to the server:

    
      docker exec -it sshserver_clie_1 bash
      ssh test@serv -i ./client -vvv
    
  you should get access to user `test` on the server without a message about new untrusted fingerprint.
